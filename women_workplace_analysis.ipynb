    "## Exploratory Data Analysis Insights: Women in the Workplace in Bangladesh (1995-2019)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Overall Trend in Female Employment\n",
    "\n",
    "The percentage of female employment in Bangladesh has shown a consistent upward trend, increasing from 24.30% in 1995 to 33.82% in 2019.\n",
    "This represents a significant increase of about 39% over the 25-year period, indicating substantial progress in women's participation in the workforce.\n",
    "The growth rate appears to have accelerated in recent years, with a notable jump between 2016 and 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Male to Female Employment Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratio of male to female employment has decreased from 28.33 in 1995 to 44.50 in 2019.\n",
    "This decreasing trend suggests that the gender gap in employment is narrowing, although men still significantly outnumber women in the workforce.\n",
    "The rate of change in this ratio has been fairly consistent, indicating steady progress in gender equality in employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Sectoral Distribution of Female Employment\n",
    "\n",
    "Agriculture has been the dominant sector for female employment throughout the period, but its share has been decreasing steadily (from 84.79% in 1995 to 59.03% in 2019).\n",
    "Both Industry and Services sectors have seen increases in female participation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Industry: from 7.66% in 1995 to 16.70% in 2019\n",
    "Services: from 7.56% in 1995 to 24.27% in 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This shift suggests a gradual transition of the female workforce from agriculture to more diverse economic activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Relationship with Fertility Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a strong negative correlation between fertility rate and female employment percentage.\n",
    "As the fertility rate decreased from 3.71 in 1995 to 2.06 in 2017, female employment increased.\n",
    "This relationship suggests that lower fertility rates may be associated with increased opportunities for women in the workforce, or vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Types of Employment\n",
    "\n",
    "The percentage of women in wage and salaried positions has increased from 18.03% in 1995 to 32.61% in 2019, indicating a rise in formal employment.\n",
    "There's been a significant decrease in contributing family workers, from 66.80% in 1995 to 27.99% in 2019.\n",
    "Own-account workers have increased from 15.07% to 38.74%, suggesting a rise in self-employment or entrepreneurship among women.\n",
    "The percentage of women in vulnerable employment has decreased from 81.87% to 66.73%, showing an improvement in job security and quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Female Employers\n",
    "\n",
    "The percentage of female employers, while still low, has shown a significant increase from 0.10% in 1995 to 0.66% in 2019.\n",
    "This six-fold increase suggests a growing trend of women in leadership and entrepreneurial roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong positive correlations exist between female employment percentage and variables like the ratio of male to female employment,\n",
    "percentage in industry and services sectors, and percentage in wage & salaried positions.\n",
    "Strong negative correlations are observed with fertility rate, percentage in agriculture, and percentage of contributing family workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions\n",
    "The data reveals significant progress in women's participation in the Bangladeshi workforce from 1995 to 2019. \n",
    "Key improvements include increased overall female employment, diversification of employment sectors, reduction in \n",
    "vulnerable employment, and a rise in formal and self-employment. However, challenges remain, as women still \n",
    "constitute a minority in the workforce, particularly in leadership roles. The strong relationship between \n",
    "fertility rates and employment suggests that family planning and support for working mothers could be important\n",
    "factors in further improving women's workforce participation.\n",
    "Future research could focus on the drivers of these changes, the impact of specific policies or economic shifts, \n",
    "and comparisons with other countries in the region to provide context for Bangladesh's progress."
