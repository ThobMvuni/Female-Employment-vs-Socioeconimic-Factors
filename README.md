# Female-Employment-vs-Socioeconimic-Factors

# README

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Introduction
The employment of women in Bangladesh faces significant challenges, despite women comprising a substantial portion of the population. Key barriers include cultural norms, limited access to education, and a lack of awareness regarding employment opportunities. These issues not only restrict women’s workforce participation but also contribute to economic disparities and inefficiencies in labor market dynamics.

This project aims to analyze a comprehensive dataset related to women's employment in Bangladesh, focusing on identifying trends and developing predictive models. By leveraging historical data, we seek to provide insights that can improve women’s workforce participation and inform policy recommendations.

#### 1.1.1 Problem Statement
Despite the potential for a robust workforce, women in Bangladesh experience low participation rates relative to their population size. Contributing factors include:

- Cultural and societal norms that limit employment opportunities for women.
- Insufficient educational and vocational training programs that restrict skills development.
- Limited public understanding of the benefits of female workforce participation.

Our goal is to analyze these factors and develop models that support strategies aimed at increasing women’s employment and enhancing overall economic productivity.

#### 1.1.2 Aim
The project aims to deliver data-driven insights and solutions that enhance workforce participation for women in Bangladesh. By analyzing key demographic, economic, and employment data, we intend to provide actionable strategies to support policymakers and organizations in fostering women's employment.

#### 1.1.3 Objectives
- Analyze demographic and economic factors influencing women's employment rates in Bangladesh.
- Study employment patterns to identify trends in sector participation and barriers to workforce entry.
- Develop predictive models to forecast employment trends and identify factors affecting women's job retention.
- Offer recommendations to improve access to education and vocational training for women.

## 2. Project Structure

### 2.1 Data
The project utilizes historical datasets that include female employment statistics, fertility rates, sector participation, and economic indicators. The data has been cleaned and prepared for analysis to ensure accuracy.

### 2.2 Methodology
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The dataset will be explored to uncover initial trends and patterns related to women's employment and participation rates.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning models will be developed to predict employment trends and identify barriers to women's participation.
- **Recommendation System**: Insights and models will be translated into actionable recommendations to improve women’s employment strategies.
